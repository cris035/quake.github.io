                    <p>November last year when my mom decided to start working out my kidney transplant. Since then, a lot of paper works and laboratory tests has been done and Iâ€™m so thankful that my brother is willing to help and donate his kidney. In less than a month, all his lab tests has good results but I had problems getting urology and cardio clearance because of the schedules of tests. It took months before I was done with the cystogram which I hate the most of all the tests. On May 2015, I was scheduled for the nuclear stress tests for my cardio clearance and it happened that they saw a clot, so the doctor told me to undergo angiogram and angioplasty with possible stent. With the help of family and ANCC church, the procedure was done in June and thereâ€™s  a big miracle because the angioplasty was cancelled because the clot seen during the nuclear stress test was gone. But in every happiness, thereâ€™s a downfall. After our case and lab results were presented to the doctors who will do the transplant, they decided to repeat the GFR scan of my brother which resulted to our big dismay. Our nephro explained to my brother that the percentage of the kidney to be donated lessened its function which resulted for him to be unfit as a kidney donor. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­</p>

                    <p>I know my brother felt depressed about this, but its more important to take good care of your health and Iâ€™m still thankful that we tried. Thank you BRO for the courage and for sharing the hardships being pricked by needles every other day in two weeks.  ðŸ‘ŠðŸ‘ŠðŸ‘Š</p>

                    

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Second Attempt</h2>

                    <p>My family didnâ€™t lose hope and our nephrologists advised us to look for another donor before my laboratory results expires. My sister started her lab tests and the first phase was okey but then her glucose level was so high so they repeated it. The doctor told her that she was unfit to be a donor because she is prone to diabetes.</p>

                    <p>We had lots of hardship this past few months, travelling to NKTI back and forth with or without Yhuan. We went to the house of representatives even though were not familiar with the place. You suffered fasting for how many days but you still did it even though youâ€™re tired from doing mommy chores at home. Donâ€™t feel bad about the result, its more important that you know your situation and know what to do and avoid. Thank you for the willingness and sacrifice that you did SIS. ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹ðŸ’‹</p>

                   <blockquote style="background-image: url('background/abc.jpg')" text-color="white"> Itâ€™s hard for us to understand Godâ€™s plan but we must still believe in Him. We should learn to wait and have more patience. Maybe, He has better plans for me, for both of you and for the family so letâ€™s continue to believe in Him and His words. As Iâ€™m writing this, I can feel a heavy heart but what can I do but to pray and just trust in the Lord. Even though I want to give up, I canâ€™t and will not. I love you both! I may not be that vocal but you know in your hearts that I love you no matter what happens. You should take good care of yourselves too and donâ€™t worry about me. I can manage âœŒâœŒâœŒ</blockquote>
