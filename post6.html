                    <p>They are my so called “kababatas” since Elementary days at Philex Mines, Tuba, Benguet. From the right is Janine “Jaja” Diso and Casey De Francia (cousin). We grew up together but been separated when our family transfered here in Baguio City after Elementary graduation. We often talk, text or chat but in our hearts, I know that we’re longing for each other and miss our childhood where we don’t have any problems aside from where and what are we going to play. 😺</p>

                    <p>My ever gandacious bes Argie Miles, during my first year High School(2003) I knew you and you became my ever so close friend, tagapagtanggol and you helped me adjust from being a probinsyana shy type to a more confident and friendly person. We’ve been thru ups and downs but our friendship got stronger. We didn’t see a lot coz we were not classmates after our first year but I can guarantee you that I’m still the Quake that you’ve known since our Nene days 😽</p>

                    <p>Rhea Padilla/Simon aka Yhang, we met during our Second Year High School(2004) at Dona Aurora High School. You became our ate and defender from those feeling gangsters LOL. You maybe a lot different from us, but we enjoyed every moment together. We laughed and cried, sing and danced, destroyed the schools old chair because we kept on dancing “I feel good – Garfield OST” and just locked someone inside the room and we did our job (to bite them as hard as we can). We separated ways after that year and we grew up differently. Our friendship had lots of colors: fun, love, fights, tampuhan in years but I can’t believe that we already attained 11 years and counting. I hope that nothing will change no matter how hard life is. 👧</p>

                    <p>Beladonna “Donna/Duday” Balanon, bunso we also met during our Second Year High School (2004) and I must say those days were the happiest, wackiest and maturing stage of our lives. You were our bunso and the very kind na tagapa kain samin sa lunch. 😋 Know what? Even though you keep on hiding from us, we still love you. No matter what you do in life, that’s your choice and we are just here when you need us. The usual circle of friends that our parents called BAD INFLUENCE back then.</p>

                    <p>Tsong! Shaika Tecne, you were my best pal during Third Year High School(2005) at Baguio City National High School Main. You helped me adjust again coz I left my friends at Dona Aurora Annex. You were my solid friend and you always buy me lunch at Mamihan. Can’t forget that I doubted you once when you told me that you were a lesbian back then but it turned out that you’re really a girl. LOL! Funny that its our 10th year anniversary as best friends and congratulations for being a complete woman! 😘</p>

                    <img src="mit/1446892533483.jpf" align="center">
                    <p>Bhez Angela “Gelai” Garchitorena! Hoy! Miss na miss na kita! Like Shaika, we met during our Third Year High School (2005) and you were so quiet at first but so noisy and galawgaw pala. I remember that you were scared of needles but not of piercing. LOL! We were separated at Fourth Year High School because they don’t believe in us. That we are not bad influence with each other so they drove you at Laguna so until now, we can’t see each other. You’re now a mom of three and a good wife to your husband. I just pray that well see each other soon coz imma hug you tight!</p>

                    <p>Rommel Ceasar Barcena “Bhogz”, oist bhez thank you for taking good care of us (Gelai and I) during our most pasaway days! I know that you’re so busy after college and now a married man. Stay cool and many treat ka naman minsan, huwag laging kuripot. Hahaha</p>

                    <img src="mit/172814.jpf" align="center">
                    <p>Maricris “Cris” Malaggay, we met on 2007 coz we are SPES babies and both assigned at the Office for Administration. You were so quiet and we both had a similarity back then. Can you remember being stressed out or mad and we both let it out by punching walls? Haha relieving but after that, we have a painful knuckles. Well, as time passed by we didn’t maintain the closeness because of having boyfriends and you preferred being closer with the other girls. I hope that our friendship lasts a lifetime. Just wanna say that I am here and I might can’t help you financially but I can give you series of advice.</p>

                    <p>Vanessa “Van/Syler/016” Sito, summer of 2007 that’s what I remembered. We met in an awkward way, about the “lighter” thingy and it started our friendship. After our (Cris and I) one month summer job, we started to volunteer at CDCC base and we grew up together. We were the pasaways, youngest and utusans. Kidding aside, it was the most adventurous part of our lives. We went out from our comfort zones, we were taught and trained and we valued the essence of life. From then, our friendship had bumpy roads but we still mananged to keep it til now. Thanks for everything! As long as I’m here, I’m useful haha. Text or PM me, I’m always available.</p>

                      <img src="mit/1446889084820.jpf" align="center">
                    <p>You were aware that you are my crush during the first month of your volunteering days at base (2008). LOL! Raybyrd “Byrd/Poclis” Gegway, you’re a very good friend and adviser. You’re my beer buddy when I’m so sad, mad and feeling crazy. You were one of the sweetest until you met your forever. I’m so happy for you! Even though I’m sick at the moment, I’m still your bhezy so don’t hesitate to text or PM me if you need a friend. 😘</p>

                     <img src="mit/IMG_20151107_172607.jpf" align="center">
                    <p>The naughtiest friend I ever had, and I’m lucky to have a friend like you. Wala kang katulad men! Ikaw na! Pinaka sa lahat: cute, kind, naughty and at times serious. Honestly, we were so busy that time passed by so easily that we never tried spending time together with the gals. Lakay kan! Hahaha thanks BROder for being my clown, text or call to cry on and everything! I’m just here, just here! And you are there! Charing! Tekker always broder! We met at the base on 2008 but been close on 2012? Not sure haha</p>


                     <img src="mit/IMG_20151107_172626.jpf" align="center">
                    <p>Bornok (Jeffrey Fabito), we knew each other at the base on February 2011. I can’t forget the first time you entered base feeling so cool because you’re the nephew of auntie Betty LOL! We are not friends at all back then coz you had a bad impression and likewise you heard rumors about me so you wanna try me. You kept on following and pissing me off until one time you even got so mad that you nearly punched me. Ehem… Just remembering things to hasten my memory. After more and more and more incidents, we became close friends and you keep on calling me dear. Now I’m okey with it. Haha, as usual bro/my dear just remember my callsign 059 and you know what to do when you need someone to talk to.</p>

                    <blockquote>Now you know them, they were all different but one thing is for sure, they are my love for a lifetime. We don’t need to talk or see each other everyday coz in our hearts we are just inches away.</blockquote>>
