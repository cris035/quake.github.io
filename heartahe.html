                    <blockquote>Love is like sunshine after the rain. Love is sweet. Love makes you “kilig”. Love is everything happy. BUT what if it’s taken away from you?</blockquote>

                    <p>When I was 17 years old, I met a guy during my student/volunteer days. At first, I never like him because I have a crush to my best friend that time. After months of people teasing us, I gave him a chance to be part of my life. He knew my family, friends and some cousins as time passes by. I remember that he went to their province for six months community service and it proved me that long distance relationships can work out depending on the couple. Well, he managed to text and call me despite the poor signal of telecommunications in that area. For six months he always make me happy and feel loved. Yikeee! Reminiscing the past? No!!!</p>

                    <p>When he got back, we continued volunteering until I encountered a problem with the seniors on May 2010 and he was left there and maybe told them that we’re not seeing each other after the incident. Problems also occurred even though I tried hard to understand him. One time, he didn’t come home for a month and didn’t even tell me why. He just came back and said sorry so I accepted him again. I’m such a LOSER! Later on, I heard that he had a relationship with one of our co-volunteer even though we’re still together.😈 Still, I never made that an issue and just forgave him and gave him another chance.</p>

                   

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Christmas</h2>

                    <p>Christmas party of 2010, one of the seniors invited me to attend so I went there and enjoyed. I thought everything was okey until one of the girls was telling me with kaartehan that she’s looking for the guy because the guy promised her that he will attend the party. (Beast Mode) Well, I can’t blame her and the newbies because they don’t know anything about me especially about the guy committed to me. I just smiled (evil smile) and observed her until the end of the party. My night was spoiled and the guy insisted for me to go home so I just went home. I waited for him to come home the next day and confronted him, but he just laughed and teased me that I am just jealous. 😕 I don’t believe him so I just got mad but he keeps on teasing me. Since then, the road got bumpy until New Year’s eve of 2011. I kept on telling him that I want to volunteer for that operation and I’ll deliver his medkit at the location of their activity but he got mad and told me that “We are done”. In just a snap, he dropped me like a hot potato. So in order to calm down, I volunteered with my best friend to another base. That feeling, while your watching the fireworks display, crying, hoping and praying that he was just kidding. 😭

</p> 

                    <p>After that, he never came home and asked me to pack all his things and to deliver it somewhere in town. On January 2011, one of the boss at the base asked me if I want to become a staff so I grabbed the opportunity to keep me busy. One day in February 2011, he came back at the base and was instructed to lecture the new volunteers for weeks. Those times were the most painful days of my life at the base because the guy and the girl badmouthed me saying “Siya yung EX na Hindi maka move on na habol ng habol Kay guy”. I can even hear the volunteers laughing and talking behind my back. Hearing such words makes me mad, pitiful and disrespected. As a new staff that time, I never wanted to hear negative things or rumors about me especially about my past so I just let it slip even though it hurts. Shame on them! “Nag volunteer sila para pag chismisan ako? Ganon?!” They judged me without knowing or asking my story? Likewise, my co staff believes them and I just have ate “A” as my real friend and the two big boss as my strength. I can say that those months were so annoying and thanks to that guy who erased all our pictures together since the beginning. It helped a lot from erasing our good memories. Everything that’s left is hate. </p>

                   <blockquote>“It was okey breaking up with a girl, but badmouthing her after giving all her life for you is a different story”.</blockquote>>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Time</h2>

                    <p>Time flies so fast, he got married on 2013, same year that I got sick. One day this 2015, I saw them together at the mall and I am proud to say that I totally moved on after four years. Finally! After four years, I can look at their faces with a smile on my lips and I can feel that I have forgiven them already. Funny but true, it took me a long time to move on. Now, I need to open my heart again so I hope and pray that the next guy to enter my life will be my forever.😍😝</p>

                    <blockquote> PS:

I hope you like the story. Hit like and post your comments! To my family and friends who knew him, don’t mention names 😂 Remember when you broke up with the love of your life, it’s not yet the end of the world. You will be in pain for a long time, but still time will let you heal and forgive. Don’t forget to pray! ☺😇😀 Thanks for reading my emo story 😝
