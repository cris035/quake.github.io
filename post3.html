                    <p>Some good driver issues were circulating on social media now a days and we are so thankful because there are still honest people here in the city. Comparing to cab drivers of Mnila based on my experience, I can say that Baguio cab drivers are more friendly, honest, respectful, caring, understanding and patient towards their passenger. </p>

                    <p>But lately, I notice a big change of what I've mentioned earlier. As a dialysis patient, I prefer riding a taxi from house to the dialysis center and vice versa for almost two years and I observed something.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Where are the understanding and caring drivers? </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physically, I look normal but I'm not. I can't walk uphill without palpitating. Not all the taxi and drivers can go straight to where I live because of the slope so they decline.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Lately, I encounter rude drivers. Being rude in terms of driving and the way they talk.</li>
                            <li>One night just after my dialysis, I was suffering from severe headache so I closed my eyes while on the way home but shocked when I slipped forward because of the sudden brake. From then, even though I sit at the back passenger's seat, I always wear the seat-belt.</li>
                            <li>Some drivers drives so fast especially at night and doesn't bother looking at their passengers if they are fine (especially in my case).</li>
                            <li>Rude by talking: Some drivers, especially the aged speak negatively about their passengers before me and kept on talking which irritates me (naglastog ngay).</li>
                        </ul>
                        

                        <li>Where are the helpful drivers? </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I encountered a driver which was being asked to stop by other drivers, maybe to ask directions but didn't even bother to stop. He even tolf me that "Istorbo lng ti byahe dayta". Is that reasonable? What if your family was in that situation?</li>
                        </ul>
                        

                        <li>Where are the honest drivers?</li>
                         <ul> 
                            <li>One late night, I suffered hypo tension during dialysis and was sent home after stabilizing but my sister rushed home to see me. When she realized that</li>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Faith and Prayer</h2>

                    <p>Being a hemodialysis patient for more than three years, I feel more challenged because I am a candidate for kidney transplant since 2014, but due to some circumstances, it is not happening. While waiting for my third donor, I was onced hospitalized way back 2014 due to pneumonia and on 2015 due to chest pain and a scheduled angiogram. I was somewhat scared because of the second one, I thought I was going to die, but my faith and prayer is stronger so I am still here struggling to live normally. The lesson here is family should be the n umber one supporter of the patient. In addition, the  doctors' advice is "family members MUST undergo an annual laboratory test to prevent any unwanted illness." My personal advice:</p>

                    <blockquote> Have a healthy lifestyle, atleast 8 hours of sleep and drink plenty of water while you still can, 'cause if you're hooked in that machine,it's GAMEOVER.</blockquote>
