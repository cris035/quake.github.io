                    <p>Some good driver issues were circulating on social media now a days and we are so thankful because there are still honest people here in the city. Comparing to cab drivers of Mnila based on my experience, I can say that Baguio cab drivers are more friendly, honest, respectful, caring, understanding and patient towards their passenger. </p>

                    <p>But lately, I notice a big change of what I've mentioned earlier. As a dialysis patient, I prefer riding a taxi from house to the dialysis center and vice versa for almost two years and I observed something.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Generally Speaking But Not All</h2>

                    <ol style="color: white">
                        <li>Where are the understanding and caring drivers? </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physically, I look normal but I'm not. I can't walk uphill without palpitating. Not all the taxi and drivers can go straight to where I live because of the slope so they decline.</li>
                        </ul>
                       

                        <li>Where are the friendly, respectful and soft-spoken drivers?</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lately, I encounter rude drivers. Being rude in terms of driving and the way they talk.</li>
                            <li>One night just after my dialysis, I was suffering from severe headache so I closed my eyes while on the way home but shocked when I slipped forward because of the sudden brake. From then, even though I sit at the back passenger's seat, I always wear the seat-belt.</li>
                            <li>Some drivers drives so fast especially at night and doesn't bother looking at their passengers if they are fine (especially in my case).</li>
                            <li>Rude by talking: Some drivers, especially the aged speak negatively about their passengers before me and kept on talking which irritates me (naglastog ngay).</li>
                        </ul>
                        

                        <li>Where are the helpful drivers? </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I encountered a driver which was being asked to stop by other drivers, maybe to ask directions but didn't even bother to stop. He even tolf me that "Istorbo lng ti byahe dayta". Is that reasonable? What if your family was in that situation?</li>
                        </ul>
                        

                        <li>Where are the honest drivers?</li>
                         <ul> 
                            <li>One late night, I suffered hypo tension during dialysis and was sent home after stabilizing but my sister rushed home to see me. When she realized that she left her cellphone (Samsung S4), she went back to check it but the driver rushed and fled. She even shouted but the driver rushed and fled. We tried to call her number but the driver didn't bother to answer. God Bless you! I hope you see this. </li>
                         </ul>

                    </ol>
                     <p style="color: white">Well, those are some of my observations. I hope that there's still hope for them to change. Some of the communication group members are rude sometimes too. They don't know that I can understand their radio codes. I also know that they prioritize children and senior citizens during rush hour. Can I also request that PWD's (person with disability) and patient's riding a cab to be prioritized? BUT how can you recognize us? Some of us looks normal but we are suffering inside. I hope and pray that the government can do something about this case. Also, the old well-known Baguio cab drivers must remain even though years pass beause it's something to be proud of by the people of Baguio.</p>
