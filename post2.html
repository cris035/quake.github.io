                    <p>Our family felt blessed to be invited in a three day mission camp which was organized by the All Nations Communnity Church who came all the way from Seongnam City, Gyunggi-Do, South Korea on May 6 - 8, 2016.</p>

                    <p>An estimate of 150 individuals from different families arrived at Hanseung Vission Church, Tagaytay City, Cavite and participated the said event. At first it was awkward to meet everyone 'cause we are all strangers, but as the organizers approach and let us feel that we are family it became easier on us. Registration, orientation, family introduction, room designation and dinner was done before going back to the sanctuary for night service worship.</p>

                    <p>Second day was kinda tough for me 'cause I need to have my hemodialysis at Tagaytay Medical Center for four hours and follow the others at Dasmari√±as Volets Resort which is an hour away from my location, but I still made it even in an unfamiliar place. It takes guts to travel alone. LOL.</p>

                   

                    <h2 cl 20ass="section-heading">The Result Is A Shock</h2>

                    <p>I was admitted at the Pines Dotors Hospital that night and Dr. Luspian came and explained that I need to undergo an emergency hemodialysis because my case is the same as my father and my uncles. I just went thru the  procedures without letting it sink in my mind.</p>

                    <p>My mom does not believe it so we had our second opinion at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute, but worst is that I needed to have a kidney transplant or a lifetime three times a week dialysis. What now?</p>

                   

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Faith and Prayer</h2>

                    <p>Being a hemodialysis patient for more than three years, I feel more challenged because I am a candidate for kidney transplant since 2014, but due to some circumstances, it is not happening. While waiting for my third donor, I was onced hospitalized way back 2014 due to pneumonia and on 2015 due to chest pain and a scheduled angiogram. I was somewhat scared because of the second one, I thought I was going to die, but my faith and prayer is stronger so I am still here struggling to live normally. The lesson here is family should be the number one supporter of the patient. In addition, the doctors' advice is "family members MUST undergo an annual laboratory test to prevent any unwanted illness." My personal advice:</p>

                    <blockquote> Have a healthy lifestyle, atleast 8 hours of sleep and drink plenty of water while you still can, 'cause if you're hooked in that machine,it's GAMEOVER.</blockquote>
