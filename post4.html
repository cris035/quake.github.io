                    <p>If I'm not mistaken, its been two years and seven months since my sister introduced us with each other. Inever like you in the beginning 'cause you're younger, weird and I hate the way you laugh!</p>

                    <p>But life is funny coz as time passed by, I started liking everything abou t you and I found the real happiness that's been missing for a long time. Maybe because its been three years that I've been single so I was easily hooked by the emotions. I was very eager, aggressive and fast which made you distance yourself from me. I was stupidly in love? I dunno!</p>

                    <p>After two months of too much effort for you, I realized something about me. It was not the same me anymore. I can't keep my cool and I suddenly got mad at myself tot he point that I never wanted to see you.</p>

                    <p>Last year, I swallowed my pride and messaged you coz you're one of the godparents of my nephew. After that, I kept seeing you around lately so I was being friendly until people kept on teasing me. At first I always tell myself that "past is past" and I will not like you again. BUT I was wrong, your smile kills me!</p>

                    <p>My sister and some friends told me to take it slowly this time and cherish the friendship. We were all good since Christmas but suddenly you were cold. A girl kept on telling things about you everytime I'm near her so I texted you that I heard a rumor about you but you don't wanna talk about it.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">I will always be ther for you</h2>

                    <p>Before those, we had planned watching a movie together coz of the pustahan LOL! But now, will it just be a plan? I thought were all good now? I know were just friends but you won't let me help you so I don't know what to do.</p>

                    <blockquote> What if I never left you before? Will there be a difference?
                    <br>Maybe, we met again to fix what happened in the past and to be good friends. Well, I'm just a call away.</br>

                    <p> To my bestfriends who will read this, I know your reaction already.</p>
